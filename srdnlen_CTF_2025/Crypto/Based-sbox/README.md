ChatGPT cooked a story for us:

    Once upon a time, after linear and differential cryptanalysis had revolutionized the cryptographic landscape, and before Rijndael was selected as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the field of cryptography was in a unique state of flux. New cryptanalytic methods exposed vulnerabilities in many established ciphers, casting doubt on the long-term security of systems once thought to be invulnerable. In response, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a competition to find a successor to the aging DES. In 2000, Rijndael was chosen, setting a new standard for secure encryption. But even as AES became widely adopted, new challenges, like quantum computing, loomed on the horizon.
